# Rust Learning Examples

Welcome to **Rust Learning Examples**, a personal playground for honing my Rust programming skills.

## Overview

This repository contains a variety of Rust example projects and exercises aimed at reinforcing fundamental concepts such as:

- Variables and data types (`variables`)
- Control flow (`controlflow`, `match_code`)
- Functions and methods (`function`, `method`, `method_syntax`)
- Ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes (`owner`, `lifetime`, `refrencing`)
- Collections and data structures (`vector_code`, `hash_map`, `string_library`)
- Structs, enums, traits, and generics (`structs`, `enum_code`, `generic_with_trait_bound`, `trait_struct`)
- Algorithms (`heap_sort`, `tree`)
- Building small applications (`guessing_game`, `todo_rust`, `snake-rs`, `text_analyzer`, `expense_tracker`)
- Additional explorations (`mindjogging`, `prediction_frequency`)

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**  
   Install Rust via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

2. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ken-kaneki-9/Rust.git
   cd Rust

## Run an Example
cd <project_name>
cargo run

##Explore and Learn
Browse through the folder names to pick what to explore. Each folder typically contains a Cargo.toml, src/main.rs, and/or other .rs files.
